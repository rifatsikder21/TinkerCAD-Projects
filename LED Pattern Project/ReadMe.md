# LED Pattern Project

This project demonstrates how to create visually appealing LED patterns using an Arduino Uno and a set of LEDs on a breadboard. It is ideal for beginners learning about microcontrollers, basic electronics, and programming.



## Overview

The LED Pattern Project uses an Arduino Uno to control a series of LEDs, creating different lighting patterns. This project is a great introduction to digital outputs, breadboarding, and programming logic.

## Components Required

- Arduino Uno R3 (1x)
- Breadboard (1x)
- LEDs (5x, assorted colors)
- 220Î© Resistors (5x)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for Arduino
- Potentiometer (optional, for brightness control)

## Circuit Diagram

The following diagram shows the wiring setup for the project:

- Each LED is connected to a digital pin on the Arduino via a resistor.
- The cathodes of the LEDs are connected to the ground rail on the breadboard.
- The breadboard ground is connected to the Arduino GND.
- A potentiometer can be added to adjust LED brightness (optional).

## How It Works

1. The Arduino sends HIGH or LOW signals to the digital pins connected to each LED.
2. By changing the order and timing of these signals in the code, you can create various LED patterns (e.g., running lights, blinking, wave effects).
3. The potentiometer (if used) allows you to control the speed or brightness of the patterns.
