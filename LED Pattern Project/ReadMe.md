## Interfacing an Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino

### Required Components
- 1 x Arduino Uno R3
- 1 x 4-pin Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)

### What is an Ultrasonic Sonar Sensor?

An ultrasonic sonar sensor is a device that utilizes ultrasonic sound waves—frequencies above 20 kHz, which are inaudible to humans—to detect objects and measure distances. The sensor works by sending out a burst of ultrasonic sound and then listening for the echo that bounces back from nearby objects.

### How It Works

1. **Emission:** The sensor emits a brief ultrasonic pulse.
2. **Propagation:** The pulse travels through the air until it encounters an object.
3. **Reflection:** The sound wave bounces off the object and returns to the sensor.
4. **Detection & Calculation:** The sensor receives the reflected echo and determines the distance to the object by measuring the time taken for the echo to return.

#### Distance Calculation Formula

$$
\text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Speed of Sound} \times \text{Time}}{2}
$$

*Note: The division by 2 accounts for the sound traveling to the object and then back to the sensor.*

### Example Sensor

- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** (commonly used with Arduino projects)

### Common Applications

- Obstacle detection in robotics
- Car parking assistance systems
- Measuring liquid levels in tanks
- Home and industrial security systems
